# prediction_demo

This was a test for hosting a predictive algorithm directly on a website, and sending form input to the model, and returning a message to the user based on the prediction.
Most of these files are automaticcaly spawned by Django, and they are quite many and quite sparse (such is the Django way)
The file prediction/prediction_app/views.py is likely the most interesting.
