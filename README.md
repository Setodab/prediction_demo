# prediction_demo

This was a test for hosting a predictive algorithm directly on a website, and sending form input to the model, and returning a message to the user based on the prediction.
As this was a part of a course on Udemy, I can't take credit for the architecture as most of these files are automatically spawned by Django, and they are quite many and quite sparse (such is the Django way). The files have been slightly tweaked to fit my needs, and the file "prediction/prediction_app/views.py" is likely the most interesting as that is where the prediction logic lives.
